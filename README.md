# Fake-News-Detection-Model-using-TensorFlow-in-Python


The main objective is to find Fake News means incorporating information that leads people to the wrong paths. It can have real-world adverse effects that aim to intentionally deceive, gain attention, manipulate public opinion, or damage reputation. It is necessary to detect fake news mainly for media outlets to have the ability to attract viewers to their website to generate online advertising revenue . we are going to develop a Deep learning model using Tensorflow and use this model to detect whether the news is fake or not.

The steps to be followed are :

First we have to do Importing Libraries and dataset then we need to Preprocessing Dataset after that we have to Generating Word Embeddings and build Model Architecture and finally we going to do Model Evaluation and Prediction .

With this code, I hope to develop a highly accurate and efficient model for the hackathon.In this way, we can build a fake news detection model using TensorFlow using python.



Importing Libraries and Dataset
The libraries we will be using are :

NumPy: To perform different mathematical functions. 
Pandas: To load dataset.
Tensorflow: To preprocessing the data and to create the model.
SkLearn: For train-test split and to import the modules for model evaluation.
